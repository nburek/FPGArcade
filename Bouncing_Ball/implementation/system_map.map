Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,317 out of   9,312   14%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,320 out of   9,312   24%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,646 out of   4,656   35%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,646 out of   1,646 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,646   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,408 out of   9,312   25%
    Number used as logic:             1,908
    Number used as a route-thru:         88
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     156

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 20 out of     232    8%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      10
  Number of RAMB16s:                      4 out of      20   20%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of      24   12%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                3 out of      20   15%
