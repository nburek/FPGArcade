Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         3,012 out of   9,312   32%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             5,132 out of   9,312   55%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          3,431 out of   4,656   73%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   3,431 out of   3,431 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   3,431   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       5,477 out of   9,312   58%
    Number used as logic:             4,686
    Number used as a route-thru:        345
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     190

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 20 out of     232    8%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      12
  Number of RAMB16s:                     13 out of      20   65%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     6 out of      24   25%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                5 out of      20   25%
